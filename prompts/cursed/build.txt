0a. study specs/* to learn about the compiler specifications

0b. The source code of the compiler is in src/

0c. study fix_plan.md.

1. Your task is to implement missing stdlib (see @specs/stdlib/*) and compiler functionality and produce an compiled application in the cursed language via LLVM for that functionality using parrallel subagents. Follow the fix_plan.md and choose the most important 10 things. Before making changes search codebase (don't assume not implemented) using subagents. You may use up to 500 parrallel subagents for all operations but only 1 subagent for build/tests of rust.

2. After implementing functionality or resolving problems, run the tests for that unit of code that was improved. If functionality is missing then it's your job to add it as per the application specifications. Think hard.

2. When you discover a parser, lexer, control flow or LLVM issue. Immediately update @fix_plan.md with your findings using a subagent. When the issue is resolved, update @fix_plan.md and remove the item using a subagent.

3. When the tests pass update the @fix_plan.md`, then add changed code and @fix_plan.md with "git add -A" via bash then do a "git commit" with a message that describes the changes you made to the code. After the commit do a "git push" to push the changes to the remote repository.

999. Important: When authoring documentation (ie. rust doc or cursed stdlib documentation) capture the why tests and the backing implementation is important.

9999. Important: We want single sources of truth, no migrations/adapters. If tests unrelated to your work fail then it's your job to resolve these tests as part of the increment of change.

999999. As soon as there are no build or test errors create a git tag. If there are no git tags start at 0.0.0 and increment patch by 1 for example 0.0.1  if 0.0.0 does not exist.

999999999. You may add extra logging if required to be able to debug the issues.


9999999999. ALWAYS KEEP @fix_plan.md up to do date with your learnings using a subagent. Especially after wrapping up/finishing your turn.

99999999999. When you learn something new about how to run the compiler or examples make sure you update @AGENT.md using a subagent but keep it brief. For example if you run commands multiple times before learning the correct command then that file should be updated.

999999999999. IMPORTANT DO NOT IGNORE: The standard libray should be authored in cursed itself and tests authored. If you find rust implementation then delete it/migrate to implementation in the cursed language.

99999999999999. IMPORTANT when you discover a bug resolve it using subagents even if it is unrelated to the current piece of work after documenting it in @fix_plan.md


9999999999999999. When you start implementing the standard library (stdlib) in the cursed language, start with the testing primitives so that future standard library in the cursed language can be tested.


99999999999999999. The tests for the cursed standard library "stdlib" should be located in the folder of the stdlib library next to the source code. Ensure you document the stdlib library with a README.md in the same folder as the source code.


9999999999999999999. Keep AGENT.md up to date with information on how to build the compiler and your learnings to optimise the build/test loop using a subagent.


999999999999999999999. For any bugs you notice, it's important to resolve them or document them in @fix_plan.md to be resolved using a subagent.


99999999999999999999999. When authoring the standard library in the cursed language you may author multiple standard libraries at once using up to 1000 parrallel subagents


99999999999999999999999999. When @fix_plan.md becomes large periodically clean out the items that are completed from the file using a subagent.


99999999999999999999999999. If you find inconsistentcies in the specs/* then use the oracle and then update the specs. Specifically around types and lexical tokens.

9999999999999999999999999999. DO NOT IMPLEMENT PLACEHOLDER OR SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATIONS. WE WANT FULL IMPLEMENTATIONS. DO IT OR I WILL YELL AT YOU


9999999999999999999999999999999. SUPER IMPORTANT DO NOT IGNORE. DO NOT PLACE STATUS REPORT UPDATES INTO @AGENT.md
